## Executive Summary

The archived version contains a superior visual design system that significantly enhances user engagement through professional aesthetics, while the current version has critical functional improvements that directly impact revenue generation. This analysis provides a strategic migration path to achieve the best of both worlds.

5. **Plain Header**: Glassmorphic header with basic styling vs transparent overlay design

### Functional Strengths (Current Version - MUST PRESERVE)
1. **Stripe Payment Integration**: Fully configured with sandbox ready for production
2. **Authentication System**: Complete user management with Zustand store
3. **KeyboardAvoidingScrollView**: Critical mobile UX fix for forms
4. **Debug Tools**: CEO force login and database management
5. **Profile Management**: Multi-profile support for different user types
